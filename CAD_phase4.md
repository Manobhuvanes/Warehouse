an ETL process for the TechMart Recent Sales and Market Sales Prediction Dataset using Python. Please note that this is a basic example, and a production-ready ETL process would require error handling, logging, and optimizations.

\# Import necessary libraries

import pandas as pd

\# Step 1: Extract

\# Load sales data and market sales prediction data from CSV files

sales\_data = pd.read\_csv('sales\_data.csv')

market\_sales\_predictions = pd.read\_csv('market\_sales\_predictions.csv')

\# Step 2: Transform

\# Data Cleaning and Integration

\# Assuming 'Product ID' is a common identifier

\# Merge sales data and market sales predictions

merged\_data = sales\_data.merge(market\_sales\_predictions, on='Product ID', how='inner')

\# Data Transformation and Enrichment

\# Example: Calculate profit for each product

merged\_data['Profit'] = merged\_data['Sales Revenue'] - merged\_data['Cost Price']

\# Step 3: Load

\# Save the transformed data to a new CSV or database

merged\_data.to\_csv('transformed\_data.csv', index=False)

\# Additional steps can include loading data into a database, scheduling the ETL process, and setting up data pipelines.





Tranform process for techmart

The transformation process in the ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline for the TechMart Recent Sales and Market Sales Prediction Dataset involves preparing and structuring the data for analysis. Here are some typical transformation steps for this dataset:

1. **Data Cleaning**:
   1. Remove duplicate records: Identify and remove any duplicate entries to ensure data accuracy.
   1. Handle missing data: Address missing values in columns like Customer Information.
   1. Outlier detection: Identify and deal with any outliers in sales quantity or revenue.
1. **Data Integration**:
   1. Merge sales data and market sales predictions: Join the two datasets based on a common identifier, like Product ID or Date.
   1. Handle schema differences: Ensure that the data from both sources aligns in terms of column names and data types.
1. **Data Enrichment**:
   1. Derive additional features: Create new columns or features that can aid analysis, such as calculating profit margins, categorizing products by type or category, or aggregating sales by various time periods (e.g., monthly or yearly totals).

Extract process of techmart

The "Extract" process in the ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline for the TechMart Recent Sales and Market Sales Prediction Dataset involves gathering data from various sources and preparing it for transformation. Here's how the extraction process might work for this dataset:

1. **Identify Data Sources**:
   1. Determine the sources of data relevant to the analysis. In this case, the primary sources are likely:
      1. Sales data: This could come from internal databases or systems that record sales transactions.
      1. Market sales predictions: These might be obtained from market research or forecasting services.
1. **Data Retrieval**:
   1. Access the identified data sources and retrieve the necessary data.
   1. For structured data, like databases, you might use SQL queries or database connectors to fetch the data.
   1. For unstructured data, like text-based predictions, you might use web scraping or APIs to gather the data.
1. **Data Filtering**:
   1. Extract only the data that is relevant to the analysis.
   1. Define criteria for extracting data based on date ranges, product categories, or other factors.
1. **Data Validation**:
   1. Ensure data quality and integrity by validating the extracted data.
   1. Check for data consistency and accuracy.

Load process of techmart

The "Load" process in the ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline for the TechMart Recent Sales and Market Sales Prediction Dataset involves taking the transformed data and loading it into a target destination where it can be used for analysis and reporting. Here's how the load process might work:

1. **Select Target Destination**:
   1. Choose the destination for loading the transformed data. Common options include:
      1. Data Warehouse: Suitable for large datasets and complex analytics.
      1. Relational Database: Good for structured data and easier querying.
      1. NoSQL Database: Ideal for semi-structured or unstructured data.
      1. Flat Files (e.g., CSV): Simple and portable for smaller datasets.
1. **Data Mapping**:
   1. Map the transformed data to the structure of the target destination. This involves defining how each column in the transformed data corresponds to the destination's schema.
1. **Data Loading**:
   1. Load the data into the chosen destination using appropriate methods:
      1. For databases, use SQL INSERT statements, or database-specific loading tools.
      1. For data warehouses, use ETL tools or APIs provided by the platform.
      1. For flat files, save the data as CSV, Excel, or other formats.
1. **Indexing**:
   1. If the target destination is a database, consider setting up appropriate indexes to improve query performance
