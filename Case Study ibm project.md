**Program Code Examples:**

**Python Code for Connecting to Db2 Warehouse:**


**import ibm\_db**

**# Replace with your connection details**

**dsn = "DATABASE=your\_db\_name;HOSTNAME=your\_hostname;PORT=your\_port;PROTOCOL=TCPIP;UID=your\_username;PWD=your\_password;"**

**conn = ibm\_db.connect(dsn, "", "")**

**# Execute SQL queries**

**sql = "SELECT \* FROM your\_table"**

**stmt = ibm\_db.exec\_immediate(conn, sql)**

**result = ibm\_db.fetch\_both(stmt)**

**while result:**

`    `**print(result)**

`    `**result = ibm\_db.fetch\_both(stmt)**

**# Close the connection**

**ibm\_db.close(conn)**


**SQL Code for Creating a Table:**

**CREATE TABLE your\_table (**

`    `**id INT NOT NULL,**

`    `**name VARCHAR(255),**

`    `**age INT,**

`    `**PRIMARY KEY (id)**

**);**

**SQL Code for Data Loading:**

**LOAD FROM your\_data\_file OF DEL INSERT INTO your\_table;**

These examples illustrate how TechMart could connect to the database and perform basic operations, showcasing the power of IBM Db2 Warehouse for data warehousing and analytics.
